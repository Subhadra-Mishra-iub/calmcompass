### Comparison:

| Feature | Local PostgreSQL | Supabase |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| Multiple users | ❌ Only on your computer | ✅ Anyone, anywhere |
| Production ready | ❌ Not accessible online | ✅ Cloud-hosted |
| Setup difficulty | ⚠️ Requires installation | ✅ 5 minutes, no install |

## 🎯 Recommendation: Use Supabase

Since you want others to use your app, Supabase is the **only real option**. Local PostgreSQL only works on your computer.

## How It Works:

1. **You set up Supabase** once (takes 5 minutes)
2. **Users sign up** on your app → Data goes to Supabase
3. **Each user's data is separate** (via user authentication)
4. **Everyone uses the same database** (but can only see their own data)

This is exactly how production apps work! 🚀
